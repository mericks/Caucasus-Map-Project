        <p>The Caucasus is a patchwork of overlapping and often conflicting geographic, ethnic, religions linguistic, and political boundaries. Traditionally, the region has been divided into two parts - the North Caucasus and the South Caucasus - each lying on its respective side of the Caucasus mountain range. The extreme geography of this region makes travel challenging even today and led to cultural development and isolation over centuries. The Caucasus can also be divided along an east-west axis based on religion, with Christians (mainly in Georgia and Armenia) to the west and Muslims to the east. Majority Muslim regions can be further divided into Shia Muslims to the east and south (mainly in Azerbaijan and Iran) and Sunni Muslims to the north and southwest (mainly in Southern Russia and Turkey). As we saw in the <a href='languages.html'>languages page</a>, all of these groups also have their own distinct languages, most of which are not mutually intelligible and many of which don’t align with ethnic or religious boundaries. Finally, the Caucasus is home to more than 35 different ethnic concentrations. They represent the geographic confluence of Europe and Asia with the Caucasian groups that have lived there for millennia.</p>

        <p>These separate and distinct groups are all contained within only six countries. The smaller Caucasian countries, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, have a developed national identity and boundaries which more or less align with their given majority ethnic groups. Turkey, Iran, and Russia on the other hand are much larger, more diverse countries containing hundreds of ethnic groups, many of which have been fighting for independence for centuries. For example, the republics of Chechnya and Dagestan in southern Russia are home to the Chechen and Dagestani peoples, who have been in a state of almost constant war with Russia since 1800. These republics remain the most dangerous regions in Russia. Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan are also not without conflict. The last two centuries have been defined by Russia’s efforts to take over the area north of the Caucasus mountains. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia during the Russo-Georgian War and still control disputed territory on the Black Sea and on its northern border.</p>
